# RPS-Simulator

## Setting up
Make sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and install Tcl/Tk support on [ActiveState](https://www.activestate.com/products/tcl/)

## Running

### Option 1
You can run the code directly with `python3 path/to/RPS-Simulator/src/rps-3_app.py` in your terminal (eg. cmd)

### Option 2
You can convert your code into an `.exe` file, though you have to change the directory to access the images in `rps-3_app.py` (eg. from `./src/images/rock.png` to `./src/rock.png`), then you can run `python3 ./RPS-3/src/setup.py build` to convert it to an `.exe` file 

Alternatively, you can download the build folder and run the `RPS.exe` file, which will show a Windows Defender Screen as it does not have a active certificate. You will have to disable it by
